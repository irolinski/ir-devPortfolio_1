      <p>
        This is an early version of a full-stack CRUD webapp meant for
        cataloguing small art collections for personal use. Its development was
        ordered by a member of a group of people collecting art as their hobby.
        <br /> <br /> It's a free, mobile-friendly and easy-to-use alternative
        to the unintuitive desktop-only collection managers that thus far were
        the only avaible option on the market. <br /> <br /> It was built using
        Node.js w/ jQuery and Bootstrap.
