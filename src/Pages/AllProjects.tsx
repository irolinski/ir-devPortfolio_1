        This is an early version of a full-stack CRUD webapp meant for
        cataloguing small art collections for personal use. Its development was
        ordered by a member of a group of people collecting art as their hobby.{" "}
        <br /> <br /> It's a free, mobile-friendly and easy-to-use alternative
        to the unintuitive desktop-only collection managers that thus far were
        the only avaible option on the market. <br /> <br /> It was built using
        Node.js w/ jQuery and Bootstrap.{" "}

        My client had a very clean vision of what she had wanted her website to
        look like. <br /> <br /> Based on her set of guidelines I prepared a
        visual UI sketch which I have then turned into code. <br /> <br />{" "}
        Components such as carousel and slideshow had to be designed from
        scratch as the ones from UI component libraries didn't fit the aesthetic
        choices ordered by my client. <br /> <br /> The site was built using
        React w/ Tailwind.

        Topsters Classic is a hobby project that I have made, channeling my
        nostalgia for the original Topsters page that I've used as a teen
        lurking music forums circa 2013. The design of the charts is recreated
        from the original charts designsand the credit for them is due to the
        developer of the original app. The UI is designed from scratch for it to
        be up to today's standards; especially in regards to mobile use.
