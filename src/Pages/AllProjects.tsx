    question: "Description",
    answer:
      <p>This is an early version of a full-stack CRUD webapp meant for cataloguing small art collections for personal use. Its development was ordered by a member of a group of people collecting art as their hobby. <br /> <br /> It's a free, mobile-friendly and easy-to-use alternative to the unintuitive desktop-only collection managers that thus far were the only avaible option on the market. <br /> <br/> It was built using Node.js w/ jQuery and Bootstrap. </ p>

    question: "Try it!",
    answer: <p>It will be an honor to have you try out this app! <br /> <br /> For this occasion, I've provided a demo account filled with dummy data. <br /> <br />The currently public alpha version of the app is deployed on a free-tier server and thus the title page make take as long as about 60 seconds to load if the page has not been visited for a short while. I apologize for this incovenience. <br /> <br /> Username: Pies <br /> <br /> Password: psy123  <br/ > <br /> Have fun!</p>
